## Design

### Design Choices
The website was designed to give a clean and professional look and feel to the user. The website looks modern while echoing the brands colors. 

### Colour
The colour scheme echos the colours of the brand, using the same dark blue/navy from their logo. I tested the color choices on WebAIM to ensure they passed the contrast test.

### Fonts
Montserrat was used for the headings and lato was used for the body. 

### Structure
The website is designed in a simple and responsive manner. The nav bar is displayed in a traditional way with logo to left and nav links to the right. On mobile the nav bar turns to a burger bar and pops out from the side upon click.
